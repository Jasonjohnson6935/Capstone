Individual E-Commerce App Requirements 
Tier 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Tier 1 relies on this third party APILinks to an external site.. This allows you to complete all aspects below. We highly encourage you to “go all the way” and make a back-end application. It is, however, not required.

Create a fully-functional front-end application from scratch or use the template provided by your instructor. 

AS A USER (NOT LOGGED IN), I SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
Access the website via the internet so I can browse and purchase products. (Deployed on a front end host)
View all available products.
View the details for an individual product, including product descriptions, photos, price, etc.
Sort products by certain characteristics (name, price, etc.).
Filter products by certain characteristics (category, type, maximum/minimum price, etc.).
Enjoy an aesthetically pleasing website with intuitive and easy to use UI/UX

AS A USER (LOGGED IN), I SHOULD BE ABLE TO:

Add an item to my cart
Have a persistent cart to revisit and pick up where I left off.
For example, I add items to my cart, close my window and go back to the website later, those items should persist.
Edit my cart if I change my mind:
Change the quantity of a product in my cart.
Remove a product from my cart.
"Check out" the items in my cart, i.e., purchase the products.
Think of the user experience when checking out on a typical e-commerce site like Amazon, etc. You can start by simulating the experience of checking out with a simple confirmation page.
